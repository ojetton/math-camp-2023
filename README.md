# Economics Ph.D. Math Camp, Fall 2023
## University of Oregon

Welcome to the GitHub page for Math Camp! Below you will find the links for all the resources you will need during this course. Math Camp will consist of 5 modules covered over 10 two-hour periods (9:00am - 11:00am) from September 6th to the 19th. Each module will be covered over two weekdays during this time according to the following schedule:

**Day 1, hour 1** Zoom lecture by Bruce McGough covering the module’s content
**Day 1, hour 2** Discussion of materials led by Graduate Employee (GE): Q&A, example problems. Practice problems posted at end of session.
**Day 2, hour 1** Group work on practice problems – idea here is that students work together, without reliance on GE.
**Day 2, hour 2** Discussion of practice problems led by GE

(The schedule may have to be altered to accommodate orientation activities that will be held on Sept 18th and 19th)
